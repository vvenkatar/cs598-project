        "text": "environmental noise, such as air and vehicle traffic, has been shown to increase stage 1 sleep and decrease slow wave and rem sleep. nighttime noise may also cause extra production of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol as well as elevated heart rate and blood pressure. a study of circadian rhythms in mice showed an increased sensitivity to noise trauma at night compared to during the day, and the researchers hypothesize this sensitivity may apply to human circadian rhythm as well. getting sufficient undisturbed sleep is critical for feeling good and performing well. although you are unlikely to notice subtle changes to your sleep structure and biochemical experience of sleep, these changes can manifest the next day in ways that are more pronounced.",
